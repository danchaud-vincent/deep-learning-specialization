It does not do well on the training set, it does not do well on the dev set, it does not do well on the test set, or it's doing well on the test set but just not in the real world. But figure out exactly what's wrong, and then have exactly one knob, or a specific set of knobs that helps to just solve that problem that is limiting the performance of machine learning system."
